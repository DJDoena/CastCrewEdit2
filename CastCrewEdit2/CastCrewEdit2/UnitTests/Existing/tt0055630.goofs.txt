<goof=In the initial fight scene, The Samurai cuts the first two adversaries in the mid-section, then slices the last man&#39;s arm off. That last man is first seen from behind holding the sword in his right arm above his head, but the arm holding the sword shown moments later is a left arm. />

<goof=When Sanjuro practices throwing the knife at a leaf, the wire on the knife is clearly visible (the scene was filmed backwards; the knife was actually pulled off the leaf by the wire). />

<goof=The 2:00 AM meeting between the gangs was clearly filmed in broad daylight. />

<goof=The interval between the noise of the gunshot and the ringing of bell is too long. />

<goof=The wire used to pull the Yakuza&#39;s cut kimono off can be seen as he gets up from the ground. />
