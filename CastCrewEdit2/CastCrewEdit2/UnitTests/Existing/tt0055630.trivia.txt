<trivia=<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000041/?ref_=tttrv_tr">Akira Kurosawa</a> told <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001536/?ref_=tttrv_tr">Toshirô Mifune</a> that his character was like a wolf or a dog and told <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0619938/?ref_=tttrv_tr">Tatsuya Nakadai</a> that his character was like a snake. Inspired by this direction, Mifune came up with Sanjuro&#39;s trademark shoulder twitch, similar to the way a dog or wolf tries to get off fleas. />

<trivia=<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001466/?ref_=tttrv_tr">Sergio Leone</a> was inspired by this film and made the famous &quot;spaghetti western&quot; <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058461/?ref_=tttrv_tr">Für eine Handvoll Dollar (1964)</a> with a similar plot. However, because Leone did not officially get permission to remake this film, which was copyrighted, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000041/?ref_=tttrv_tr">Akira Kurosawa</a> sued him and delayed the release for three years. Leone paid him a sum plus 15% of the profits. Interestingly enough, Kurosawa himself stated that he based his movie on <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034798/?ref_=tttrv_tr">Der gläserne Schlüssel (1942)</a>, an adaptation of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0358591/?ref_=tttrv_tr">Dashiell Hammett</a>&#39;s novel, without officially crediting either source. However, various critics and readers of Hammett&#39;s work have noted that Yojimbo&#39;s overall plot is closer to Hammett&#39;s &quot;Red Harvest&quot; and not &quot;The Glass Key.&quot; />

<trivia=Although the most common meaning of the word &quot;Yôjinbô&quot; is &quot;bodyguard&quot;, the etymological origin of the characters (kanji) meant a stick or pole used for self-defense. Depending on the context, it can also mean a &quot;bar&quot; (e.g. on a door) or a &quot;bolt&quot;, or instead of bodyguard, it can mean &quot;security&quot;, &quot;guard&quot; or &quot;watchman&quot;, always in the sense of &quot;protector&quot;. />

<trivia=<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000041/?ref_=tttrv_tr">Akira Kurosawa</a> asked his sound engineer <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0590988/?ref_=tttrv_tr">Ichirô Minawa</a> to come up with a sound effect to be used when a sword is cutting, and killing, someone. After testing out slicing a sword into beef and pork, he finally found the perfect sample: putting two wooden chopsticks inside a raw chicken, then hacking it with a sword. />

<trivia=<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2728142/?ref_=tttrv_tr">Masaru Sato</a> was instructed by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000041/?ref_=tttrv_tr">Akira Kurosawa</a> to write &quot;whatever you like&quot; so long as it was not the usual period samurai film music so commonly used by all the major studios at the time. He ended up writing something that was inspired by one of his idols, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000049/?ref_=tttrv_tr">Henry Mancini</a>, whom he had the pleasure of meeting shortly after the film was released, where they discussed his &quot;Yojimbo&quot; soundtrack. />

<trivia=<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000041/?ref_=tttrv_tr">Akira Kurosawa</a> challenged his assistant directors to come up with an image for the film to let Sanjuro know he was entering a bad town. He shot down all of their ideas, since all of them had already been done. Kurosawa himself then came up with the idea of the dog carrying the human hand. />

<trivia=This is an uncredited film version of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0358591/?ref_=tttrv_tr">Dashiell Hammett</a>&#39;s novel &quot;Red Harvest&quot;, which has never been officially filmed. It is about a detective who comes to a small city and pits both sides in a gang war against each other until both are almost completely wiped out. The scenes where <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001536/?ref_=tttrv_tr">Toshirô Mifune</a>&#39;s character is held and beaten, however, were taken from Hammett&#39;s novel &quot;The Glass Key&quot;, which has been adapted for the screen twice. />

<trivia=The massive amount of dust seen being blown about was actually imported by the truckload from an abandoned firing range. When the wind machines started, it was nearly impossible for the actors to keep their eyes open because they were being engulfed in the dust. When <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0619938/?ref_=tttrv_tr">Tatsuya Nakadai</a> was shooting his death scene, over the course of three days, the combination of the fake blood and the blowing dust made him break out in hives that lasted for weeks after filming. />

<trivia=In one scene the samurai shows incredible skill at knife-throwing by impaling a blowing leaf against a wooden floor. This was accomplished by running the shot backwards. In the frame before the knife hits the leaf, you can see a slit in the leaf the same size and at the exact point where the knife penetrates it a frame later. />

<trivia=When asked his name, the samurai calls himself Sanjuro Kuwabatake. He makes up this name while looking at a mulberry field near the town. Thus, the character can be viewed as an early example of the Man with No Name from the Dollars series of westerns directed by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001466/?ref_=tttrv_tr">Sergio Leone</a> starring <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000142/?ref_=tttrv_tr">Clint Eastwood</a>. />

<trivia=<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000041/?ref_=tttrv_tr">Akira Kurosawa</a>: [weather] Like in most Kurosawa films, rainy weather is present in a few scenes, increasing the effect of the characters&#39; discomfort. The windy weather all throughout the film represents the chaotic life in the town. />
