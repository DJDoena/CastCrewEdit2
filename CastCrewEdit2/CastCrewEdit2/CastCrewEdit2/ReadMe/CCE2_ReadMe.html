<h2><a name="GeneralInfo">General Info</a></h2>

<p>
This program helps you to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing" target="_blank">parse</a> movie / TV Show sites
from IMDb to use the cast, character and crew information in DVD Profiler.
</p><p>
Please use only the us-english version of the IMDb website (<a href="http://www.imdb.com">www.imdb.com</a>), it won't
work in other languages.
</p><p>
This program is for personal use only, commercial use of IMDb data is forbidden by IMDb and the use of IMDb data in the
DVD Profiler online database is forbidden by Invelos.
</p><p>
You can select (click on the row header) one or more rows in the crew result grid and then delete them by
pressing DEL on your keyboard.

<h2><a name="Settings">Settings in Settings Dialog and on the Main Form</a></h2>

<p>
    The features you enable or disable in the Setting dialog will be made permanent. When you start the program these
are the settings that will be set.
</p><p>
But you can override them on the main dialog by enabling/disabling a feature for this session.
</p>
<p><a href="#TOC">Table of Contents</a></p>

<h2><a name="GetBirthYears">About "Get Birth Years"</a></h2>

<p>
It's not possible to get too many birth year informations at a time, the IMDb server blocks the calls after a 
varying number of requests.
</p><p>
Therefore I only get the cast list without attempting to get the birth years, too.
</p><p>
You have to retrieve the birth years afterwards by pressing "Get Birth Years". Even then an error might come up that
says "503 Webservice unavailable". Simply try to press "Get Birth Years" again until the program tells you that the 
parsing is finished.
</p><p>
Then you can press "Copy Cast/Crew to Clipboard" as usual.
</p><p>
If you don't want or don't need the birth years you can also skip this entire step and simply press "Copy Cast/Crew to
Clipboard" after retrieving the cast data.
</p>
<p><a href="#TOC">Table of Contents</a></p>

<h2><a name="Cache">Local Birth Years and Persons Cache</a></h2>

<p>
In order to ensure linkability for the cast and crew the "common name" and the birth year of a person must be identical.
IMDb ensures this, that's the whole reason this program exists. Still, even on IMDb a common name or the birth year can
change. If that happens, all data parsed after that point are incompatible with the ones that were parsed before (e.g.
birth year of "John Smith" changes from 1920 to 1921.
</p><p>
To find such changes, all queried persons are stored in two local files: 
<a href="Data\Cast.xml" target="_blank">\Data\Cast.xml</a> and <a href="Data\Crew.xml" target="_blank">\Data\Crew.xml</a>
</p><p>
It contains the parsed name and the birth year (if available). The identifier is the IMDb link. If the common name or
the birth year changes, the program will inform you of this.
</p><p>
Since parsing the birth years is a time-consuming task, the program stores birth years in a local cache that will be
cleared when the program ends. The cache is only valid during the run of the program.
</p><p>
But there's a new perfomance-enhancing option: You can chose to take the birth year from the above persons cache instead
of parsing IMDb. The program will still parse IMDb if the birth year is not in the local person cache, but if it has
already parsed this person for his/her birth year in a former run of the program, it will take it from the local cache.
</p><p>
Warning: If you enable this perfomance enhancement, you won't notice if the birth year on IMDb has changed.
</p>

<h2><a name="PersonsCache"></a>Lokale Cachedateien <a href="..\Data\Cast.xml" target="_blank">\Data\Cast.xml</a>
&amp; <a href="..\Data\Crew.xml" target="_blank">\Data\Crew.xml</a></h2>

<p>
For the purpose of these files, see <a href="#Cache">Local Birth Years and Persons Cache</a>.
</p><p>
<span style="color:#FF0000; font-weight:bold;">DO NOT</span> delete this file, even when you are installing a new
version of this program. If you delete this file the program can't check whether common names or birth years have
changed since you've started using this program. This could lead to inconsistencies in your DVD Profiler database and
break the linking feature.
</p><p>
These files are not part of the install package.
</p>
<p><a href="#TOC">Table of Contents</a></p>

<h2><a name="ConfigFiles">Parsing Configuration Files</a></h2>

<p>
The program comes with a number of text files that can be edited by the user to enhance the parsing process.
</p>

<h3><a name="IMDbToDVDProfilerCrewRoleTransformation"></a><a href="..\Data\IMDbToDVDProfilerCrewRoleTransformation.xml" target="_blank">\Data\IMDbToDVDProfilerCrewRoleTransformation.xml</a></h3>

<p>
This file contains the mapping information from the crew roles in IMDb to the ones in DVD Profiler. 
</p><p>
In IMDb every crew member belongs to a certain section (like "Direction" or "Art Department"). You can find these
sections when you open a movie / TV Show episode in IMDb and click on the link "full cast and crew" in the left
navigation bar.
</p><p>
The easiest way to edit IMDbToDVDProfilerCrewRoleTransformation.xml is to use the program 
"EditIMDbToDVDProfilerCrewRoleTransformation.exe". It will open the file and present the data in a comprehensive way.
You can edit it there and then save it with the program.
</p>

<h3><a name="KnownFirstnamePrefixes"></a><a href="..\Data\KnownFirstnamePrefixes.txt" target="_blank">\Data\KnownFirstnamePrefixes.txt</a></h3>

<p>
Usually the first word of the name becomes the firstname and the rest will be parsed into middlename and lastname. But
there are circumstances where the first word is only part of the firstname, for example if it is a royal or a military
title ("Dame", "Capt.").<br/>
You can edit the file and add additional firstname prefixes there (only one word per line though).
</p>

<h3><a name="KnownLastnamePrefixes"></a><a href="..\Data\KnownLastnamePrefixes.txt" target="_blank">\Data\KnownLastnamePrefixes.txt</a></h3>

<p>
Usually the last word of the name becomes the lastname and the rest will be parsed into firstname and middlename. But
there are circumstances where a word before the lastname is part of the lastname, for example if it is a dashless
lastname or a royal prefix ("de la", "van", "Bonham" as in "Bonham Carter").<br/>
You can edit the file and add additional lastname prefixes there (only one word per line though).
</p>

<h3><a name="KnownLastNameSuffixes"></a><a href="..\Data\KnownLastNameSuffixes.txt" target="_blank">\Data\KnownLastNameSuffixes.txt</a></h3>

<p>
Usually the last word of the name becomes the lastname and the rest will be parsed into firstname and middlename. But
there are circumstances where the last word is only part of the lastname, for example if it is a military
title or an inherited name ("USMC", "III", "Jr.").<br/>
You can edit the file and add additional lastname suffixes there (only one word per line though).
</p>

<h3><a name="StageNames"></a><a href="..\Data\StageNames.txt" target="_blank">\Data\StageNames.txt</a></h3>

<p>
This file has become obsolete since 1.8.0.0.
</p>
  
<h3><a name="IgnoreCustomInIMDbCategory"></a><a href="..\Data\IgnoreCustomInIMDbCategory.txt" target="_blank">\Data\IgnoreCustomInIMDbCategory.txt</a></h3>

<p>
This file is optional, thus it won't be delivered with Cast / Crew Edit 2.<br/>
It is created as soon at it's needed.<br/>
Sie wird erstellt, sobal sie benötigt wird.<br/>
If you want "Custom" crew, you still might not want "Custom" crew from all IMDb Categories.
These are listed here (e.g. "Music Department").<br/>
You can edit the file and add (additional) IMDb Categories there (one per line).
</p>
  
<h3><a name="IgnoreIMDbCategoryInOther"></a><a href="..\Data\IgnoreIMDbCategoryInOther.txt" target="_blank">\Data\IgnoreIMDbCategoryInOther.txt</a></h3>

<p>
This file is optional, thus it won't be delivered with Cast / Crew Edit 2.<br/>
It is created as soon at it's needed.<br/>
If you want to have "Other" crew, you still might not want all IMDb Categories.
These are listed here (e.g. "Transportation Department").<br/>
You can edit the file and add (additional) IMDb Categories there (one per line).
</p>
  
<h3><a name="KnownNames"></a><a href="..\Data\KnownNames.txt" target="_blank">\Data\KnownNames.txt</a></h3>

<p>
In this file names are stored that require special parsing. They can be stage names (e.g. "Meat Loaf"), or
people with complex last names (e.g. "Helena Bonham Carter", where "Bonham Carter" is the last name).<br/>
Every line has to contain three semicolons (";"). The divison is as follows:<br/><br/>
&lt;Complete IMDb Name&gt;;&lt;First Name&gt;;&lt;Middle Name&gt;;&lt;Last Name&gt;<br/><br/>
You can edit the file and add additional names there (one name per line).
</p>
    
<h3><a name="ForcedFakeBirthYears"></a><a href="..\Data\ForcedFakeBirthYears.txt" target="_blank">\Data\ForcedFakeBirthYears.txt</a></h3>

<p>
In this file IMDb IDs are stored for which a manual birth year is determined.<br />
It can be used to seperate people with the same names and birth years, or to re-unite identical people that have two different IMDb IDs.<br/>
An entry in this list overrides any other Birth Year setting.<br/>
Every line has to contain one semicolon (";"). The divison is as follows:<br/><br/>
&lt;IMDb-ID&gt;;&lt;Fake Birth Year (between 1 and 65535)&gt;<br/><br/>
You can edit the file and add additional IDs there (one ID per line).
</p>

<h2><a name="SettingsFile"></a>Settings File <a href="..\Data\CastCrewEdit2Settings.xml" target="_blank">\Data\CastCrewEdit2Settings.xml</a></h2>

<p>
The file \Data\CastCrewEdit2Settings.xml contains the settings you have set in the
<a href="#Settings">Settings Dialog</a>.
</p><p>
This file is not part of the install package.

<h2><a name="StartupParameters">Startup Parameters</a></h2>

<h3><a name="skipversioncheck">/skipversioncheck</a></h3>

<p>
If you start the program with the parameter /skipversioncheck then it won't check if a new version is available for
download.
</p>
<h3><a name="lang">/lang</a></h3>

<p>
The program has english and german UI texts. If your Windows is set to a german UI, the program will present itself in
german. If it's in english or any other language, it will present itself in english.
If you wish to override that behaviour, add the startup parameter /lang=de or /lang=en.
</p>
<h3><a name="browser">/browser</a></h3>

<p>
    If you start CastCrewEdit2.exe with this /browser switch, it will use a different browser control for you to find the title you're looking for.

My personal handle on this issue is that a credit will be split if the actor actually plays different people (for
example Michael J. Fox played in "Back to the Future: Part III" the characters "Marty McFly" and "Seamus McFly") but not
if it is the same person (for example "Bruce Wayne / Batman").

  <li>Added additional cast/crew ID check to detect profile merges by IMDb. Unfortunately this makes the parsing a bit slower but is necessary to ensure the consistency of the data.</li>
  <li>
    Added new tool: FindMergedCastCrew.<br/>
    This tool will allow you to scan your local cast and crew file for profile merges done by IMDb (see above). It will give you the results so you can adapt your DVD Profiler database.<br />
    The option to save the result in a different file was deliberately so your original file remains untouched. Once you've processed the results you can simply delete your original file and 
    rename the new one. Or you can choose to overwrite your cast/crew file immediately.<br />
    The result will look like this:

    Warning: This tool might be running for several hours, depending on the size of your cast/crew file. But you can start it twice and have your cast and your crew file checked simultaneously.<br />
    Due to the long running time it is possible to pause the scan, save the intermediate result and continue the scan at a later time. There will not be an output file until the scan is completed.<br />
    I would run FindMergeCastCrew every few months, depending on your purchase volume.
  </li>
  <li>Added API to remote-control CCE2 from another application and use the CCE2 scan results without any need for copy&amp;paste.</li>

<h3>Version 1.7.0.1</h3>

  <li>

    If this option is used, all cast and crew member which do not have a birth year of their own
    (because birth years are generally not read from IMDb or IMDb has none for that particular person)
    get a fake birth year based on their IMDb ID.<br /><br />
    This way you can distinguish between people who appear to be identical from DVD Profiler's point of view
    (see also the ReadMen of &quot;Check for Duplicates in Cast/Crew Edit 2 Cache&quot; farther down).<br /><br />
    Bevor you start using the new fake birth years, you should use the programs
    &quot;Check for Duplicates in Cast/Crew Edit 2 Cache&quot; and &quot;Compare ProfilerXML and Cast/Crew Edit 2 Cache&quot;
    to compare the local cache of &quot;Cast/Crew Edit 2&quot; and your local DVD Profiler data and clean it if necessary.

      WARNING: Do NOT run "Check for Duplicates in Cast/Crew Edit 2 Cache" and "Cast/Crew Edit 2" at the
      same time.



      DVD Profiler can distinguish people only by four criteria:
      Last Name
      First Name
      Middle Name
      Birth Year

      If these four things are all IDentical DVD Profiler cannot tell these two people apart.

      "Check for Duplicates in Cast/Crew Edit 2 Cache" helps you to find such possible collsions.

      In the tab "Everything IDentical" you see all the entries that could be such mismatches.

      "Could" because of the introduction of fake birth years, derived from the IMDb ID of the
      actors/actresses.

      The comparison if two actors possibly clash is done under the exclusion of the fake birth year and
      only looks at the "real" data.

      But IMDb is not perfect either. Sometimes they create a new actor page for an actor that already
      exists.

      When they notice their mistake, one of the IDs is forwarded to the other, pretty much transparent to
      the user (only visible in the URL of the website).

      By the time IMDb notices their mistake, you might already have both IDs in your local cache.

      Until now this wasn't a problem because of DVD Profiler's concept. It simply merged these two entries
      again.

      With the introduction of fake birth years it might happen that this one person is actually
      consIDered two different people in your local database.

      Here's an example: The actor Benjamin Hoffman was listed under the IDs nm2200880 and nm1887263 in
      my local database, but both IDs led to the latter one, see: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2200880/

      To find these possibly IDentical people, switch to the "Everything IDentical" tab and check if
      the pairs are actually only one person. If so, simply remove the outdated ID.

      If this outdated ID already has a fake birth year assigned you should check your DVD Profiler
      database and merge the actors there, too.

      Another interesting case was  Elizabeth Rodriguez whom I had as nm1879985 and nm3318694 but both
      IDs led to nm0735300 which I hadn't.

      So I saved and closed "Check for Duplicates in Cast/Crew Edit 2 Cache", opened "Cast/Crew Edit 2"
      and scanned one of her works that has few cast in it (for time-saving purposes), in her case
      "Beadhead" http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0165634/

      Now I had three IDs of hers in my cache and could savely remove the two outdated ones.

<h3>Version 1.6.1.2</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Fix for crew custom roles.</li>
</ul>
  
<h3>Version 1.6.1.1</h3>

<ul>
  <li>IMDb changed their page encoding from ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.6.1.0</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Fix in reading the birth year (problem has been there since early january!)</li>

<li>Yet another season number fix.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.6.0.1</h3>

<ul>
<li>Season number / episode name download fixed to match new IMDb code.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.6.0.0</h3>

<ul>
<li>To improve the detection of possible duplicate entries, I decided to treat cast and crew seperately - just like DVD Profiler.<br/>
Thus from version 1.6.0.0 on the local cache file Persons.xml will be replaced by two files:<br/>
Cast.xml and Crew.xml.<br/>
<br/>
With the help of the added tool ConvertCastCrewEdit2PersonFile.exe the existing Persons.xml can be split into the new files.<br/>
To achieve this it's necessary to use the actual DVD Profiler collection as reference.<br/>
It has to be exported completely via &quot;DVD Profiler -> File -> Export Profile Database&quot;.<br/>
Based on that file I try to determine which entry is a cast and which is a crew member..<br/>
If the backup option is used, a file called Persons.xml.org is created which is identical to the original Persons.xml and remains unchanged.<br/>
All persons that cannot be find in either the cast or the crew list, will be put into a third (unused) file called Persons.xml.old.<br/>
<br/>
After the conversion Cast/Crew Edit 2 can be used normally again.<br/>
<br/>
Note: This process will not be perfect. If there's an actor Joe Sixpack (1977) and a different screenwriter Joe Sixpack (1977),<br/>
both entries will land in both files because based on the DVD Profiler collection data I cannot tell them apart.<br/>

<h3>Cast Edit 2 Version Hints</h3>

<pre>
End of Development: v1.2.4.5 is the last version of Cast Edit 2. Please upgrade
to Cast/Crew Edit 2, which can also be found under
http://doena-soft.de/dvdprofiler/index_en.php

== Version 1.2.4.5 ==
Minor Bugfix regarding exlusion of uncredited cast.

== Version 1.2.4.4 ==
IMDb has once again changed their HTML code. I tried to optimze my Regular
Expressions so that it is more lenient. 
Hope that helps.

== Version 1.2.4.3 ==
Sorry for so many versions in such a short time, but this time IMDb has changed
somtehing again and I had to adapt.

== Version 1.2.4.2 ==
Error when copying to clipboard.

== Version 1.2.4.1 ==
Minor parsing bug in character names.

Error when copying to clipboard.

== Version 1.2.4.0 ==
Code Optimization and adaptions to IMDb's recent changes.

Use command line parameter "/skipversioncheck" to skip version check on startup.

Reorganized the Help menues.

== Version 1.2.3.1 ==
Check, whether or not the readme.txt is actually there.

== Version 1.2.3.0 ==
IMDb has adapted it's HTML code and I had to react.

== Version 1.2.2.0 ==
I've created an additional file that stores all actor info you've retrieved from
IMDb. This way I can check whether a common name or a birth year has changed
when you scan the same actor at a later time. The program will then give you a
warning, that you should check your actor list in DVD Profiler. You can also use
my program "Find Name Duplicates" to check your database.

Additionally I created a check on startup, if a new version is available.

== Version 1.2.1.0 ==

It's no longer possible to get too many birth year informations at a time, the
IMDb server blocks the calls after a varying number of requests.

Therefore I only get the cast list without attempting to get the birth years,
too.

You have to retrieve the birth years afterwards by pressing "Get Birth Years".
Even then an error might come up that says "503 Webservice unavailable". Simply
try to press "Get Birth Years" again until the program tells you that the
parsing is finished.

Then you can press "Generate" as usual.

If you don't want or don't need the birth years you can also skip this entire
step and simply press "Generate" after retrieving the cast data.

<h3>Crew Edit 2 Version Hints</h3>

bugfixes in EditIMDbToDVDProfilerCrewRoleTransformation.exe -> Version 0.1.1.0

Also added EditIMDbToDVDProfilerCrewRoleTransformation.exe for comfortable
editing of IMDbToDVDProfilerCrewRoleTransformation.xml

Changed CreditType and CreditSubtype to DropDowns, now they are changable.

== Version 0.2.0.0 ==
New features added
retain original credit: if checked, that the custom role will be filled with the
                        credit from IMDb even if a match to a DVD Profiler has
                        been found
include credit type prefix: if checked, credits that fall under the CreditType
                            Other/Custom will get a prefix of the IMDb
                            CreditType

== Version 0.1.0.1 ==
If it is a Other/Custom credit without any description I take the IMDb
CreditType name

== Version 0.1.0.0 ==
First draft of the program. Please report all bugs you encounter.

Please note, that it is necessary to "map" the IMDb crew roles to the
DVD Profiler crew roles. For this you have to edit the file 
"IMDbToDVDProfilerCrewRoleTransformation.xml". You find all valid combinations
for DVD Profiler in the sample file "AllDVDProfilerCrewRoles.xml".

It's no longer possible to get too many birth year informations at a time, the
IMDb server blocks the calls after a varying number of requests.

Therefore I only get the cast list without attempting to get the birth years,
too.

You have to retrieve the birth years afterwards by pressing "Get Birth Years".
Even then an error might come up that says "503 Webservice unavailable". Simply
