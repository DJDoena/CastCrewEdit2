<trivia=Rizzo&#39;s hickeys were real. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000330/?ref_=tttrv_tr">Stockard Channing</a> said in an interview that <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001063/?ref_=tttrv_tr">Jeff Conaway</a> insisted on applying them himself. />

<trivia=In 2019, Dame <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000556/?ref_=tttrv_tr">Olivia Newton-John</a> auctioned the leather jacket and pants she wore in the finale for $405,700, for the benefit of her cancer research charity. Spanx founder Sara Blakely bought the pants. The anonymous winning bidder of the leather jacket, which sold for $243,200, later returned it to Olivia. />

<trivia=In the stage play, the song &quot;Look at Me, I&#39;m Sandra Dee&quot; had a reference to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000543/?ref_=tttrv_tr">Sal Mineo</a>, who was murdered in 1976. For the movie, the lyric was changed to reference <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000062/?ref_=tttrv_tr">Elvis Presley</a>. Ironically, the slumber party scene in the movie, and the song, was filmed on August 16th, 1977, the day Presley died. />

<trivia=&quot;Hopelessly Devoted to You&quot; was written and recorded after the movie had wrapped. Dame <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000556/?ref_=tttrv_tr">Olivia Newton-John</a>&#39;s contract for Grease stipulated that she should have a solo song. However, nobody had any ideas for a song for her character, Sandy, until Olivia&#39;s producer John Farrar came up with &quot;Hopelessly Devoted To You&quot; halfway through the shoot. Director Randal Kleiser wasn&#39;t wholly convinced by the song at first and had to come up with an entirely new scene to fit it in. It was eventually filmed and recorded after the movie had wrapped and it earned the film&#39;s only Oscar nomination. />

<trivia=<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001063/?ref_=tttrv_tr">Jeff Conaway</a> was so infatuated with Dame <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000556/?ref_=tttrv_tr">Olivia Newton-John</a> he was tongue-tied whenever she was around. He later married Olivia&#39;s sister, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0628617/?ref_=tttrv_tr">Rona Newton-John</a>. />

<trivia=Co-creator Jim Jacobs said the controversial ending, when Sandy conforms to the Greasers and changes her look to fit in with the T-Birds and the Pink Ladies, was actually supposed to be spoofing movies when the rebel gives up his bad ways at the end and decides to turn over a new leaf. Instead of having the bad boy repent and become a good guy at the end of Grease, which is what the audience was expecting, the good girl goes bad. />

<trivia=<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005288/?ref_=tttrv_tr">Marie Osmond</a> told <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005092/?ref_=tttrv_tr">Larry King</a> that she turned down the role of Sandy because she &quot;didn&#39;t want my teenagers some day to say, you know, &#39;You have to go bad to get the boy.&#39; It was just a personal choice as a some day mother.&quot; Additionally, Osmond told FOX News, &quot;The script came to me, and (it) was much edgier then what Olivia came up with. But I was at a place in my life where I wanted to have children and I didn&#39;t like the fact that the girl had to turn bad to get the guy. I think the guy has to work hard to get the girl, that&#39;s what I believe.&quot; />

<trivia=Some reviewers compared this to another movie that came out about star-crossed high school lovers - Good News (1930) - which was about the 1920s. Here&#39;s what one notable critic said: &quot;Plot isn&#39;t exactly what &#39;Grease&#39; is all about: In fact, it&#39;s really just an updating of that 1927 musical, &#39;Good News.&#39;&quot; Good News (1930) and Good News (1947) similarly followed the story of two high school students from different cliques, and the kind of dance of flirtation and fighting they go through until they finally come together at the end. />

<trivia=<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0083279/?ref_=tttrv_tr">Patricia Birch</a>: The Choreographer, and Director of Grease 2 (1982), is one of the dancers during the contest. />

<trivia=<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000299/?ref_=tttrv_tr">Michael Biehn</a>: When Danny (John Travolta) and Kenickie (Jeff Conaway) put the frog in Patty&#39;s (Susan Buckner&#39;s) bag. He can also be seen in the scene where Coach Calhoun is trying to show Danny how to play basketball. NOTE: This is not strictly a cameo appearance, which happens after an actor or actress has achieved success. This was simply an uncredited appearance early in Biehn&#39;s career, while he was still a struggling actor. />
